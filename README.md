I made the Demolish. I used the Unity Editor and C# for coding. I want to explain What I did.

-Player Movement .

-Shooting System.

-Zombie AI.

-Collisions.

-Obstacles.

-GameManager.

-UI

I didn't upload the game. In my Improving_Projects repo is available. the adres is below.

I want to say 'sorry' because I used the Unity FPS controler. There is a convert error for WebGl. I can play via Windows platform, not webgl. I will improve again. You can check my other games.
